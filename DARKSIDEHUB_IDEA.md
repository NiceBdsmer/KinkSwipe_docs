# DarkSideHub Hub Concept

## Goal
Build `darksidehub.com` as a curated hub that blends tools, articles, and education into a single kink exploration destination. KinkSwipe becomes one of several featured tools instead of the entire product.

## Core Principles
- Privacy-first, consent-forward tone.
- Educational, non-judgmental framing.
- Multi-tool layout: apps, guides, and resources.
- Fast, mobile-first, and easily shareable.
